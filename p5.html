        “Divination, in one form or another, has at some time been practiced in
        almost every culture. In general, it is a decision-making process,
        utilizing, as part of the process, a randomizing mechanism.”

      <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            For Project #5, We will use Javascript to create a browser-based
            divining experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your divination experience should take some sort of
            input from the participant (i.e. text, or even camera input) and give
            them some sort of output (a written message, an image, a sound, etc)
            based on their input. Your divination experience should load json data from an API.
            When you design your experience, you should take into strong
            consideration how you prompt the participant.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, think about the ritual you want to create and the purpose it serves. For example,
            you may ask a participant to hold a certain thought in mind, or stand up
            and move their body. Consider how the interface you create for your
            divination experience communicates to the participant. You may also want
            to consider which parts of the divination experience are completely
            random, and which ones you want to control.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the p5 palm reader above, works by having multiple sets of
            fortunes based on palm line length. A set of fortunes for small lines, a
            set of fortunes for long lines. Based on the length of the line, it will
            randomly choose from one set vs. the other. In this way, the ritual is both
            influenced by the participant and unique in its randomness. Think about
            the mechanics of rituals you already partake in in your life and how they
            relate to the technologies we will be using (code).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is up to you in terms of how you want to approach this prompt conceptually.
            For example, you might translate an existing divination ritual into code, or
            you may come up with a completely new one. The intention can be serious, such
            as self-reflection/connecting to nature, or it can be more satirical, such
            as building a divination ritual to decide which classes to take next
            semester. It's up to you to! Just be clear and communicative about your
            concept.
        </p>

 <h2>Design Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        (1) You must incoroprate either data from JSON(online or in your codebase) or with an API <br />
        (2) You are encouraged to use Vanilla JS but can resort to p5 is you have too much difficulty<br />
        (3) The data that the user is providing needs to correspond or communicate with the data that exists in the JSON file or API. <b>You are essentially creating an algorithm. What data do you want to receive form users and what information do you want to produce for them based on what they provide?</b><br />

      <h3>Loading & Displaying Data</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadTable">loadTable()</a>
        is a p5 function that reads the contents of a CSV file and creates a
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">p5.Table</a> object with
        its values. The CSV file must either be located in the sketch's folder
        or elsewhere online.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.images.fecom-media.com/HE1546624_160911-HOP-ENG-P01.jpg?width=348"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Using loadTable() with a local CSV file, let's try to recreate the
        "sentence flip book" children often use to learn how to construct
        sentences. First, open your desktop spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel) or
        Google spreadsheet, and let's create a couple possible sentences for the
        flip book. In the example below I'm using a name, a verb, and a food
        item to construct every sentence. Keep in mind that these sentences must
        follow the rules of modular design, so that different combinations of
        the words would still make out logical sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you're done with that, download the spreadsheet as a CSV file, and
        upload it to your p5 sketch folder. When you click on the CSV file
        inside the p5 editor, you should see something like this:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-26%20at%201.25.08%20AM.png?v=1582698317988"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        If you look carefully, you might notice that every new line creates a
        new row, and every comma creates a new column. You can edit your CSV
        file inside the editor if you decide that something needs to change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Great! Now let's load the table into the sketch! Just like loading any
        other files in p5, you need to load the CSV file using
        <i>function preload()</i>. Also, inside the p5.Table object, there are a
        couple methods you should know about in order to properly load and
        display the data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getString"
            >getString(row, column)</a
          >: retrieves a String value from the Table's specified row and column.
          Based on the example above, <i>getString(0,0)</i> will retrieve the
          word "Anshuman", and <i>getString(3,2)</i> will retrieve "dumplings"
        </li>
        <li class="bullet">
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getColumnCount"
            >getColumnCount()</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/getRowCount"
            >getRowCount()</a
          >: returns the total number of columns or rows in a Table. It's used
          in a similar way as array.length
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/hb73hbbK"></iframe>
        <p>&#8627; click to randomize sentence</p>

        <p>
          To put it all together, I have used <i>random()</i> to generate three
          different row numbers within the range of <i>getRowCount()</i> at the
          start of the sketch as well as when every time mouse is pressed. And I
          use <i>text()</i> three times to load the possible sentences
          individually:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/aacbce3f23bcddff8b82b8380c7987e5.js"></script>
      </div>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/hb73hbbK"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        So while you're trying this out on your own, you might have noticed that
        a couple lines are being repeated a couple different times to do similar
        things. You could try to combine them into for Loops to write less lines
        of code. However, you'd need to turn your <i>row1</i>, <i>row2</i>, and
        <i>row3</i> variables into a <i>row[]</i> array in order to load them
        properly. Here's the
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/n_1zbjwh"
          >optimized version</a
        >
        of the code above.
      </p>

      <h3>Overwriting Data</h3>

      <p>
        Now that we know how to load data from a CSV file and turn it into a
        p5.Table object. Let's learn how to overwrite a cell value inside a
        table object using
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table/set"
          >set(row, column, value)</a
        >. Add the lines below to the end of setup() inside the previous code
        example:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ffe3e8bd8d75785e21a245380834581b.js"></script>
      <p>
        Now when you click on the screen, you should see that column 0 - row 0
        has now been set to "Chloe":
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/SBGCIRZo"></iframe>

      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/SBGCIRZo"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >
      <p>
        There are
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Table">many other methods</a>
        you could use under p5.Table that goes beyond what has been mentioned
        above. Take a look at them to get a sense of what's possible.
      </p>

      <div id="join">
        <h2>JavaScript join()</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the examples above, each word has a position X and Y. What if we want
        to connect the words together so that there are no spacings in between?
        This is where
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"
          >JavaScript join()</a
        >
        comes in handy. join() is a method that connects all the items inside an
        array together to form a string. For instance, copy & paste the code
        below into your p5 editor:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/c9be3e001d14eda3b34b1b6657939a95.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now try to replace <i>sentence.join(" ")</i> to
        <i>sentence.join("-")</i>:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/7b896ff92dfb127dda6ee5e31eb288f7.js"></script>
      <p>
        You will see that console now prints 'I-&lt3-programming'. Essentially,
        join() makes all the items inside an array hold hands with each other!
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let's add join() and splice() to our previous example, so that
        when mouse is pressed, splice() will add sentences to an empty array,
        and join() will help to format the sentence.
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/Mqn01a4f"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; click to add sentence to the array</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/5105f0f6f122081e05a3b4ff2fade9b7.js"></script>

      >

      <div id="substring">
        <h2>JavaScript substring()</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring"
          >substring()</a
        >
        method lets you access and load part of a string. The method takes up to
        two parameters: the start of the index and the end of the index. By
        using this method, we could create a typewriter effect inside our
        sketch. This makes the reading experience more engaging and less
        daunting, especially when you're displaying a large amount of texts:
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/_HvJLGKo"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; click to see the typewriter effect</p>

      >

      <div id="input">
        <h2>User Input</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you want to incorporate user's input, such as a character's name into
        the story, you could add a text field using
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createInput">createInput()</a>
        and a button using
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createButton"
          >createButton()</a
        >
        for text submission. This get into accessing the
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp"
          >HTML DOM</a
        >, which will be covered extensively in the next project. So don't worry
        if you feel like you don't completely understand how it works on the
        backend for now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's start by creating a button that will let us randomize the
        background color every time it's pressed. The first step is to simply
        create the button, and make the button display a string to indicate what
        it does:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/4f8dcad2b1ed8ad6ceb9330cc4fcb1ca.js"></script>
      <p>
        Now you've got a clickable button, but the button doesn't do anything
        yet. So let's add another line of code inside setup() that will make the
        button executes a function:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/866f46be751d4b406c23698019a5c081.js"></script>

      <p>
        And let's create <i>function changeBG()</i> and define what is supposed
        to happen when the function is executed:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/17e2c36df1d3b740866d1762637db347.js"></script>

      <p>
        Neat! Now when you pressed the button, it should randomly changes the
        background color. Next, let's change the position of the button so that
        it's overlapped with the sketch. For this, you would have to go to your
        style.css file inside the data folder. Add the following lines to the
        file:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/75bbcec2408f59e26d8d215c64c5b2ae.js"></script>

      <p>Your sketch should looks like this:</p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/8fbpy54r"></iframe>

      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/8fbpy54r"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        There are many other options for styling the CSS button. You can learn
        more about them
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp">HERE</a> and
        try it out in your sketch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, let's add a text field so that when the user enters their name
        into the program, it will be stored inside an array. Besides the text
        field, we also need a button so that the user can submit their text.
        Let's start by creating the variables:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/c351e8f9203dc872d9976e11c5a58a34.js"></script>

      <p>And then create the text field and the button inside setup():</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/65af232a76410535eda9f17f2da617ee.js"></script>
      <p>
        The next step is to create a function called <i>addName</i>, and use
        splice() to add a new name into our empty array every time
        <i>function addName()</i> is executed.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ada2ba5262b2054f0606bf56c6e4e78d.js"></script>

      <p>
        Try to enter a couple names into the text field. Because we've set
        splice() to delete one item every time it's executed,, you should see
        the new name replacing the old name. Now let's display this information
        inside draw():
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/a0804f6ec33ce651f6ffc83ad5a9a1fa.js"></script>

      <p>
        And finally, let's style the text field and the button inside style.css
        so that they would be overlapped with the sketch. You can take a look at
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp">CSS Forms</a> to
        learn more about styling the text field.

      <div id="external"><h2>Working with External Data</h2></div>
      <p>
        Working with external data is a huge topic. There are endless amount of
        data on the internet we could possibly draw from, and the topic of your
        story could really determine what kind of data you would be searching
        for. As of today, CSV, XML, and JSON are the most commonly seen data
        format on the web. CSV is older and still widely used in the fields of
        science, while JSON is newer and widely used in commercial applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Intro to JSON</h3>
      <p>
        JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It was derived from
        JavaScript and therefore looks
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@easyexpresssoft/object-literal-vs-json-7a2084872907"
          >similar</a
        >
        to a JavaScript object literal, however JSON is an independent data
        format and uses the extension name <b>.json</b>! I'm not expecting you
        to become a fluent JSON programmer through this project, however, since
        JSON is going to be one of the most common data format you will be
        encountering online, let's learn about the basic JSON syntax so that we
        are not totally lost when we encounter this type of external data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say I'd like to create a profile for a cat I've met in Portland,
        Oregon last summer. On a spreadsheet it would look like this:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-03-04%20at%201.49.17%20AM.png?v=1583304565741"
          style="height: 70px"
        />
      </div>
      <p>As a JavaScript object literal it would look like this:</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/07c53dc8c07663d35dc3344d4de0ef38.js"></script>
      <p>And as a JSON object it would look like this:</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e2c33296f3587ae5dd56ead2ef981c81.js"></script>
      <p>
        The outer pair of curly brackets (line 1 & 10) indicate the begining and
        closing of the JSON object; and the inner pair of curly brackets (line 3
        & 9) indicate an object within an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, let's take a look at Darius Kazemi's wonderful project
        <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora">Corpora</a>, a repository
        of JSON files containing words ranging from the animals to the
        government. Let's use the
        <a
          href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dariusk/corpora/master/data/animals/cats.json"
          >cats.json</a
        >
        file in the repository for our next example. Similar to loading the CSV
        file, we're going to load the JSON file in p5 preload() using
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON">loadJSON()</a>:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/90b2500556fd77bf3e98f955d6ee6832.js"></script>
      <p>
        When <i>catObj</i> gets printed into your console, you should see that
        there is an array called <i>cats</i> living inside the JSON object. This
        is an important piece of information that would help us access the
        specific cats inside the array in the next step.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-03-04%20at%202.09.15%20AM.png?v=1583305765096"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now we can use a dot operator to access deeper layers of the JSON file:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/6dd012fd280b56d563e95108b39a473c.js"></script>
      <p>
        Here's a developed version of the sketch that would choose a random cat
        from the list and use it inside a sentence:
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/Q7yUr-WB"></iframe>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/3037a89f3ae91edbaaa07e78ecc6baa2.js"></script>
      </div>

      <p>
        The entirety of JSON syntax is basically made up of objects {} and
        arrays []. The basic idea is simple but the structure could get really
        complicated when the amount of data is large. If you're interested in
        learning more, read about nested arrays and nested objects

      </p>

      <div id="api">
        <h2>Working with API</h2>
      </div>
      <h3>What is an API?</h3>
      <p>
        API stands for application programming interface. It consists of
        pre-written commands that allow two different pieces of software to
        speak to one another. Allegorically, API is like a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/w224x9Z4YYs?t=3">bird whistle</a>
        that helps human (software 1) to communicate with birds (software 2).
        When we work with an API over the web, we are most likely trying to
        retreive some form of data from a server into our p5 sketch. For
        example, let's say we would like to retreive live weather data from the
        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map</a>. In order to
        do this, we need to check whether it's got an API, and most importantly,
        whether the API is well documented with clear instructions for how to
        use it. You should refrain from using an API that has vague
        instructions.
      </p>

      <h3>What is an API key?</h3>

      <p>
        In order to proceed with your API journey safely, you need an API key.
        You can think of an API key as a password that has been randomly
        generated for you by the server in order for you to access its database.
        Every time your program runs, you'd be making a request to the server to
        send data over. Before the server sends the data back to you it would
        asks for your API key. Usually, you would generate a new API key for
        every software you create. And you can cancel / delete the API key when
        the software is no longer in use. A more detailed explanation can be
        found in this video:
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, walk through the process of
        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/price">signing up</a> and obtaining
        an API key from Open Weather Map. And let's move into p5 editor to
        implement the API!
      </p>

      <h3>Implementing the API</h3>

      <p>
        Take a look at the
        <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current">instruction</a> for making
        an API call on Open Weather Map, and you should see that this is how
        you'd make an API call (just like a bird call!):
      </p>

      <p>
        api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={your api
        key}
      </p>

      <p>
        When you adapt the call for your own use, you need to swap
        <i>{city name}</i> to the name of your city (e.g. New York) and
        <i>{your api key}</i> to your API key. Paste the line into the URL field
        inside your browser and you should see raw JSON data that shows the most
        updated information on the current weather. Amazing!
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's take this info into p5. First, we'll use a variable to hold
        the URL for our API call. And we'll load in using loadJSON():
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/90c3d7a9b91c3ff7b568dea420509f1f.js"></script>

      <p>
        Next, let's create a function called <i>getData</i>. This function will
        handle the JSON object that is retrieved when setup() is executed.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/409d156e80c3e77a37dba0d0735c72b6.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now, when you print <i>data</i> inside <i>getData()</i>, you should see
        the JSON data inside the console. Use dot notation to access deeper
        layers of the data. For instance:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1b851837667b9f8fcad930d3cca3575c.js"></script>
      </div>

        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        Here is another example of an API implementation, using
        <a href="https://developer.wordnik.com/">Wordnik's API</a>. It lets you
        access various types of dictionary data:
