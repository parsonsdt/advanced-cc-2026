      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        For project 4, you will be tasked with using HTML/CSS and Javascript, to
        create an interactive quiz or tool!<br /><br />

        While your quiz or tool can be about anything, it must center a specific
        group/demographic/community and providing some kind of experience or
        opportunity to the group. You can choose to define that community and
        what it means for you, on your own terms. Just be sure and explicit
        about who it is for, and why you’re making it.<br /><br />

        It is best to center a group that you have DIRECT relationships with and
        not make assumptions about other groups. Nevertheless, we encourage you
        to research your chosen group as to not solely rely on your own lived
        experiences and assumptions about what the potential need or opportunity
        may be. You’ll want to define the challenge and use your quiz or tool as
        potential, feasible solution that addresses some or all of that
        challenge.
        <br /><br />
        Technical Requirements:<br /><br />

        (1) Your Quiz should have at least 8 questions<br />
        (2) Have user input through form elements and event handlers (think:
        buttons!)<br />
        (3) Store user input using local storage<br />
        (4) Taking those locally stored answers and using them to change aspects
        of the webpage<br />
        (5) Work locally with HTML, CSS and Javascript<br />
        (6) Store your code cleanly in a Github Repository<br />
        (7) Testing and documenting your quiz with users<br />
        (8) Have a well documented README.md file highlighting your design
        process, inspiration and references, challenges you faced and next steps
        for the project if you had more time to complete it and create a second
        version.

  <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
</div>

<p>
  Using vanilla Javascript can seem really intimidating at first to new
  learners. What we have been learning already, p5, is a library that is
  built off of Javascript. The advantage of using p5 is that there are
  many functions already built into the library so you don’t have to write
  out the code for them. When writing vanilla Javascript you may have to
  take extra steps to write code that you wouldn’t have to before. Much of
  the language overlaps though and building on top of the knowledge you
  already have you will be able to write Javascript without any worries!
</p>

<p>
  When creating your own Javascript file, you will just need to name it whatever you 
  want and make sure it ends with the extension .js. You will then want 
  to add your file to your HTML by adding the line:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="myScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  in your body tag. We are going to introduce ourselves to JS by creating a button 
  that will console log “Hello World”.
</p>

<p>
  First we need to add the below line of code into our html body tag to
  create a button. Which will show up like the image below, you can style
  your button however you want in CSS by giving it an ID. The button below
  I have added padding to so we can see it more clearly.
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button id="myButton"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

<div class="full-width-box">
  <img src="imgs/clickMe.png" />
</div>

<p>
  Now without any Javascript written when you click the button nothing
  will happen. This is where we will write our own vanilla Javascript
  function. Functions are written the same way as they are in p5, and you
  can use the template below as a starting point.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/13d5f5c5e9342f534ab3975e131c96e0.js"></script>
      
<br>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/bd9f3e49ae0baa9f4290db8d955abd10.js"></script>

<p>
  To connect this function to our button, we need to add a bit more code to our HTML line.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Method 1: Using the `onclick` Attribute</h3>

<p>
  The `onclick` attribute is an example of an event handler that we can define in 
  HTML to run a function when an element is clicked. It does not have to be a 
  button—many different types of event handlers exist that allow us to detect 
  user interactions.
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button id="myButton" onclick="helloWorld()"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  Now, when you press the button, you should see “Hello World” appear in the 
  console.
</p>

<h3>Method 2: Using `addEventListener`</h3>

<p>
  Instead of defining the `onclick` function directly in the HTML, we can attach 
  an event listener in our JavaScript file. This method is preferred in larger 
  projects because it keeps HTML and JavaScript separate.
</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", helloWorld);</code></pre>

<br>

<h3>Understanding Event Handlers</h3>

<p>
  Event handlers allow elements to respond to user interactions. Some common ones include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>onmouseover – Runs when the mouse hovers over an element.</li>
  <li>onmouseout – Runs when the mouse leaves an element.</li>
  <li>onkeydown – Runs when a key is pressed.</li>
  <li>onkeyup – Runs when a key is released.</li>
  <li>onchange – Runs when a form element changes (e.g., selecting a dropdown option).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can explore more event handlers and how they work on 
  the <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/html_5_event_handler_content_attributes.cfm">
    Quackit JavaScript Event Handlers</a> page.
</p>

<div class="full-width-box">
  <img style="height: 100px" src="imgs/helloWorld.png" />
</div>

<p>
  With this foundation, you can start experimenting with interactivity and build more complex web applications!
</p>
<br>

      <div id="query"><h2>Document Query Selector</h2></div>
      <p>
        Document Query Selector is a Javascript method that returns the first
        element that matches a CSS selector. This can allow us to dynamically
        change something in a document by finding elements with the selector and
        changing them within a Javascript function. We will be using the button
        we created in our intro to Javascript to create a function that grabs a
        div with selector and changes its color.
      </p>
      <p>You can insert your div first by using the following code:</p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/f58667b714fafe560d94a7ce8ef3dea4.js"></script>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/09f95fd2ff8fb0532c2837dd3f7549c5.js"></script>
      <p>Which will leave you with this result to start:</p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="imgs/helloWorldClickMe.png"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now we can start looking at our Javascript again and creating a function
        that will change our divs background color. Below is the code we will
        use to start.
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/22aa573a0bcfe9c9ce28eda6af86c135.js"></script>
      <p>
        This shows a function that looks for your div id, “#myDiv”, and then
        will console log what it finds so we can double check that it is
        selecting the correct element. The selector will search the entire page
        for an element that matches and then will return it in the log. To allow
        this function to work you will have to change the function that is
        running in your html to onclick = ”changeColor()”. You will be able to
        see this in your console now:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
        style="height: 150px"
          src="imgs/logDiv.png"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        To change the divs background color on click you will need to add this
        line in your Javascript function underneath what we’ve already written.
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/lizard-ctrl/826d291b53ce3f3f5cb573930f9894ca.js"></script>
      <p>
        This allows our function to look within the html file to find your div
        and change the styles background color to “red”. You can expand on this
        further by adding boolean statements to your function to toggle back and
        forth.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="imgs/helloWorldColorChange.gif"
        />
      </div>
<!--       <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/lizardctrl/sketches/DjKycx0Hu"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      > -->
      <p>
        You can use the document query selector to select anything on your html
        file and change its style in whatever way that you want to. You can do
        many different creative stylings with it!
